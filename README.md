# SandSquare

**SandSquare** is a modern, browser-based sandbox simulation game inspired by the classic "Falling Sand" game. Originally popularized in the early 2000s as a Flash game, **SandSquare** brings the same addictive physics-based gameplay to the web with added features, better graphics, and more possibilities.

## Features

- **Customizable Grid Size**: Adjust the grid size and pixel density to match your screen resolution and preferred level of detail.
- **High-Performance Rendering**: Optimized for modern browsers, ensuring smooth performance even with large quantities of particles on screen.

## Upcoming Features

- **Expanded Block Selection**: New materials and elements will be added, each with unique properties and interactions.
- **Eraser Tool**: Remove particles from the simulation with a simple click.
- **Advanced Physics**: Improved particle interactions, including friction, cohesion, and more complex reactions.
- **Customizable Simulations**: Allow users to modify gravity, particle behavior, and other simulation parameters.
- **Save and Share**: Save your creations and share them with friends online.
- **Level Editor**: Design your own levels and challenges within the simulation.
